## Installation

### Setup and run your virtual environment
1. Use the packmanager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install virtualenv
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
2. Make a directory (e.g. `python-sdk`) and `cd` into it
3. Run `virtualenv venv`. This is going to create a `venv` folder inside your directory.
4. Now run `source venv/bin/activate` which will activate the virtual environment and you will see "(venv)" on the left.
5. To deactive, simply type `deactivate` into your terminal.
